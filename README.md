Tic Tac Toe LAN
==========================

These are the Java files used in a more extensive project developed as a team
with my class in ISEP.

Mostly this is my code though some components (like the comunication layer) had
been developed by a friend (Alberto Azevedo).

More information about the project (as some UML designs) can be seen in the
package-info and images.
